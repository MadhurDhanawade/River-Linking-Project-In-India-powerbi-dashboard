The River Linking Project in India aims to connect major rivers across the country to address water scarcity and improve irrigation. This project involves constructing dams, canals, and reservoirs to transfer water from water-rich areas to drought-prone regions. The initiative is intended to enhance agricultural productivity, provide drinking water, and manage flood risks. However, it faces challenges such as environmental concerns, displacement of communities, and high implementation costs.
